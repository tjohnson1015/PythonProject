Welcome to Lost trivia!

Throughout this game you will have to answer trivia questions about the tv series "Lost."

Each question you answer correctly will unlock one of 6 numbers you need to get off the island.

Once numbers are unlocked, you need to enter them in "Leave the island menu"

In order to play, you just need to go to the "main" page and run the "start_game" function.

For now, no modules to import because I can's get the music module to load. Im not as smart as Chase :(

Good Luck!
